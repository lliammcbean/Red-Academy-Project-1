# Red-Academy-Project-1

Web page created with HTML and CSS. A simple design project to learn language skills.

HTML problems encountered mostly to do with floats. Messing around with inline-block and overflow:hidden to get the page layout was a learning process.

CSS problems mostly to do with font-upload. Also encountered problems with margins and styling the inputs. Last CSS problem came with background transparency and rgba() functions, couldnâ€™t fiddle it to work.

Looking through there are a few things that need to be looked at but are simple problems that should be solved easily.
